# Kota Application

To those who’ve grown up in the townships of South Africa, where the spazas sell popular street food unique to this socio-economic and geographic area,
a kota is a kota – and like nothing else. Built using the latest ReactJS (16.x) library by Facebook, the Kota app, is a full featured application built with user experience in mind.

## Setup
Setting up a ReactJS project is as easy as:

* Install dependencies, on the terminal type ```yarn install```.
* Run the application, ```yarn start```.
* To build files for deployment on a server: ```yarn run build```

## What's Next?
The application is actively being developed hence watch-out for a load of ReactJS features e.g. unit testing, UI automated tests using Cypress and Integration with
backend frameworks/languages such as NodeJS and Spring Boot.
